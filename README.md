# My Personal Portfolio and UI experimentation ground 
Live at [ammarnasir.com](http://ammarnasir.com/). It's more than just a personal site. I constantly use this website to create and experiment building insanely customizable UI components. My end-goal is a UI components library which offers more customizability and power than usual libraries out there. 

## Why its special to me

Every single component, graphic, and most icons are built from scratch. I built this website starting with my own [Fatefy UI template](https://github.com/Fanoflix/fatefy) to demonstrate Fatefy's complete customizability. 

## Feedback
I would love any [feedback/suggestions](https://ammarnasir.com/contact) you might have regarding the code, look, content or anything else regarding the website.
